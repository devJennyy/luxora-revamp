   A fully responsive e-commerce website that offers a modern and seamless online shopping experience. Designed with a sleek, modern interface, and provides a browsing experience that is both easy and enjoyable.     This project showcases both my front-end development and UI design skills. I personally designed the high-fidelity prototype and brought it to life using React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. All data was       manually stored using  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase-100000?style=flat&logo=firebase&logoColor=white&color=FFCA28" alt="Firebase" />, and the product information is sourced from various          online references.
